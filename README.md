[**Arxiv Version**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14454)

We prove that medical LLM should be first pretrained with domain corpus, and then tuned with instructions following dataset.

We have released The latest model **PMC_LLaMA_13B** finetuned on our instructions the following dataset.
It has shown a better ability to follow user instructions than MedLLaMA_13B.

Similarly, it can be easily loaded with:

```python
import transformers
import torch
tokenizer = transformers.LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained('axiong/PMC_LLaMA_13B')
model = transformers.LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained('axiong/PMC_LLaMA_13B')
```
Hereby we present PMC_LLaMA's versions and briefs.

[MedLLaMA_13B](https://huggingface.co/chaoyi-wu/MedLLaMA_13B) is pretrained on medical corpus, and [PMC_LLaMA_13B](https://huggingface.co/axiong/PMC_LLaMA_13B) is further finetuned based on that.

## Latest News
We have released a new multilingual medical LLM **MMedLM**, you can find detailed information in [here](https://github.com/MAGIC-AI4Med/MMedLM). 

It is **better than PMC-LLaMA** even in the English domain while it has not passed instruction tuning, thus is more suitable for fine-tuning instead of zero-shot or few-shot prompting. 

## Environment
Simply set up the required environment as following:
```bash
conda install pytorch==1.13.0 torchvision==0.14.0 torchaudio==0.13.0 pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install transformers=4.28.1, sentencepiece, datasets
```

## Quick Start
Check `simple_test.py` for quickly use PMC-LLaMA or you can follow this folowing simple sample.

```python
import transformers
import torch
tokenizer = transformers.LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained('axiong/PMC_LLaMA_13B')
model = transformers.LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained('axiong/PMC_LLaMA_13B')
model.cuda()  # move the model to GPU

prompt_input = (
    'Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.'
    'Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n'
    '### Instruction:\n{instruction}\n\n### Input:\n{input}\n\n### Response:'
)

example = {
    "instruction": "You're a doctor, kindly address the medical queries according to the patient's account. Answer with the best option directly.",
    "input": (
        "###Question: A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination. "
        "She states it started 1 day ago and has been worsening despite drinking more water and taking cranberry extract. "
        "She otherwise feels well and is followed by a doctor for her pregnancy. "
        "Her temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 122/77 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air."
        "Physical exam is notable for an absence of costovertebral angle tenderness and a gravid uterus. "
        "Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?"
        "###Options: A. Ampicillin B. Ceftriaxone C. Doxycycline D. Nitrofurantoin"
    )
}
input_str = [prompt_input.format_map(example)]

model_inputs = tokenizer(
    input_str,
    return_tensors='pt',
    padding=True,
)
print( f"\033[32mmodel_inputs\033[0m: { model_inputs }" )


topk_output = model.generate(
    model_inputs.input_ids.cuda(),
    max_new_tokens=1000,
    top_k=50
)
output_str = tokenizer.batch_decode(topk_output)
print('model predict: ', output_str[0])
```


## Training

The training process can be divided as two phases: pretrain and instruction-tuning.

**Pre-training**

The script for pretraining locates at `Pretrain/training.sh`.

Our pretraining dataset sources from [S2ORC](https://github.com/allenai/s2orc). Only those papers with PubMed IDs are deemed as medical-related and used during pretraining.
<!-- The raw training data can be dowloaded from [S2ORC](https://github.com/allenai/s2orc), filter out the papers with PubmedCentral IDs, and you can get the training data we use.  -->

The book is listed in this repo as [MedicalBook.xlsx](https://github.com/chaoyi-wu/PMC-LLaMA/blob/main/MedicalBook.xlsx), due to licenses, we cannot release raw content. For reproducing, pls buy and process the books.

More details about how to fine-tune LLaMA can refer to [Finetune_LLAMA](https://github.com/chaoyi-wu/Finetune_LLAMA)


**Instruction Tuning**

We also provide instruction tuning script at `SFT/train.py`.
And you can find our instruction dataset at [PMC LLaMA Instructions](https://huggingface.co/datasets/axiong/pmc_llama_instructions).

Note that, the manual and zero-shot results with * are referred from [LMFLow](https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow/tree/main/src/lmflow).


### Zero-shot Cases

We demonstrate PMC_LLaMA_13B's responses with out of domain queries.

<img src=./figures/pmc_llama_cases.png>

Note that, due to train on the papers, MedLLaMA_13B may generate some citation numbers (LLaMA somtimes will do this as well) and we dismiss them in the cases to show the main contents.
While for PMC_LLaMA_13B, it's much easier to extract the correct answer as the output result is structured.
